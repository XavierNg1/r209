     Group 17: c2w protocol specification proposal (Binary Version)
                     draft-ietf-xml2rfc-template-05

Abstract

   This document presents a protocol specification for the binary
   version of the C2W - Chat While Watching - protocol.  The aim of this
   protocol is to allow a client to chat on each types of room of the
   application.  There are two (2) types of room : The main room and the
   movie room associated with a movie.  The client will be able to send
   and receive messages in each of a chat rooms one at a time.

1.  Introduction

   The purpose of the C2W protocol is to allow client with other clients
   to chat on each specific types of room of the application: the main
   room or one the watching room.  Each client MUST know the IP address
   or the name and the corresponding port number of the server.

   We will specify in the later section of the document, the different
   formats of the messages that will be sent.

   Clients can use UDP or TCP to exchange messages with the server.  The
   server MUST use the same layer four used by the client.

   Examples will be shown later in this document in order to understand
   better the protocol.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2.  Packet format

   Describe the packet format and the headers.  For example, if you have
   a binary header, you can use a figure like the following example
   (where we have used the generic name "Field" for most of the fields,
   you should use the names corresponding to your solution):


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |    Field 1  |   Field 2   |      Field 3      |   Field 4     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |           Field 5             |                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               |
       |                                                               |
       .                                                               .
       .                       Message Data                            .
       .                                                               .
       |                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

3.  Example scenario

3.1.  Scenario 1: title

   Description of the scenario and then the corresponding messages:

   MSG 1 from toto to titi

   etc

   You can also use a figure like this:

        Alice                                            Bob
           |                                               |
           |             Message 1 (Request)               |
           |---------------------------------------------->|
           |            (details of the message)           |
           |                                               |
           |                                               |
           |               Message 2 (Response)            |
           |<----------------------------------------------|
           |                   (Details)                   |


4.  Conclusion

   Your conclusion goes here.

5.  xml2rfc Features

   In this sample file, the following sections show how to use some of
   the features of supported by xml2rfc.  This is a non-exhaustive list.
   It is up to each group to decide which of these features (if any) to
   use in the protocol specification.

   This document is a modified version of the Internet-Draft template by
   Elwyn Davies, available on the IETF website [IDSample].

6.  Simple List

   List styles: 'empty', 'symbols', 'letters', 'numbers', 'hanging',
   'format'.

   o  First bullet

   o  Second bullet

   You can write text here as well.

7.  Figures

   Figures should not exceed 69 characters wide to allow for the indent
   of sections.

                 Preamble text - can be omitted or empty.

   +-----------------------+
   | Use XML, be Happy :-) |
   |_______________________|

        Cross-references allowed in pre- and postamble. [min_ref].

                                 Figure 2

   The CDATA means you don't need to escape meta-characters (especially
   <(&lt;) and &(&amp;)) but is not essential.  Figures may also have a
   title attribute but it won't be displayed unless there is also an
   anchor.  White space, both horizontal and vertical, is significant in
   figures even if you don't use CDATA.

8.  Subsections and Tables

8.1.  A Subsection

   By default 3 levels of nesting show in table of contents but that can
   be adjusted with the value of the "tocdepth" processing instruction.

8.2.  Tables

   .. are very similar to figures:

     Tables use ttcol to define column headers and widths.  Every cell
                  then has a "c" element for its content.

                          +----------+----------+
                          | ttcol #1 | ttcol #2 |
                          +----------+----------+
                          |   c #1   |   c #2   |
                          |   c #3   |   c #4   |
                          |   c #5   |   c #6   |
                          +----------+----------+

                      which is a very simple example.

9.  More about Lists

   Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
   the hangIndent:

   short   With a label shorter than the hangIndent.

   fantastically long label  With a label longer than the hangIndent.

   vspace_trick
           Forces the new item to start on a new line.

   Simulating more than one paragraph in a list item using <vspace>:

   a.  First, a short item.

   b.  Second, a longer list item.

       And something that looks like a separate pararaph..

   Simple indented paragraph using the "empty" style:

      The quick, brown fox jumped over the lazy dog and lived to fool
      many another hunter in the great wood in the west.

9.1.  Numbering Lists across Lists and Sections

   Numbering items continuously although they are in separate <list>
   elements, maybe in separate sections using the "format" style and a
   "counter" variable.

   First list:

   R1  #1

   R2  #2

   R3  #3

   Specify the indent explicitly so that all the items line up nicely.

   Second list:

   R4  #4

   R5  #5

   R6  #6

9.2.  Where the List Numbering Continues

   List continues here.

   Third list:

   R7  #7

   R8  #8

   R9  #9

   R10 #10

   The end of the list.

10.  Example of Code or MIB Module To Be Extracted

   The <artwork> element has a number of extra attributes that can be
   used to substitute a more aesthetically pleasing rendition into HTML
   output while continuing to use the ASCII art version in the text and
   nroff outputs (see the xml2rfc README for details).  It also has a
   "type" attribute.  This is currently ignored except in the case
   'type="abnf"'.  In this case the "artwork" is expected to contain a
   piece of valid Augmented Backus-Naur Format (ABNF) grammar.  This
   will be syntax checked by xml2rfc and any errors will cause a fatal
   error if the "strict" processing instruction is set to "yes".  The
   ABNF will also be colorized in HTML output to highlight the syntactic
   components.  Checking of additional "types" may be provided in future
   versions of xml2rfc.


   /**** an example C program */

   #include <stdio.h>

   void
   main(int argc, char *argv[])
   {
       int i;

       printf("program arguments are:\n");
       for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
           printf("%d: \"%s\"\n", i, argv[i]);
       }

       exit(0);
   } /* main */

   /* end of file */
